# Python-Projects
In this repository there are some Python projects developed entirely by me.
MasterThesis files are scripts belonging to my Master Thesis in computational and numerical astrophysics. **_Jets_detection_** aim is to detect, analyzing big amounts of data from a astrophysical simulation, Jets of matter and energy. **_ShockWave_detection_** purpose is to detect the growing shockwave position of a collapsing massive star.
